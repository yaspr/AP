- Introduce parallelism concepts: threads, mutex, barriers, conditions, scalability, ...
- Introduce PThreads
- Work:
	- Implement a reduction using PThreads
	  - Local thread reduction variable --> final reduction during the join
	  - Using a mutex for synchronizing the threads
	- Implement a reduction using SSE or AVX and PThreads
	- Compare the performances of all versions
	- Evaluate the scalability of the reduction implementations
