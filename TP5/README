- Introduce caches
- Introduce cache optimizations: tiling, blocking, and prefetching
- Work:
	- Implement a dgemm in C and measure its performance
	- Add a new version with blocking and compare the performances
	- Add a new version with tiling and compare the performances
	- Use other compilers and compare the performances
